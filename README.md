In this project, I built a honeypot in Azure Sentinel and ingested logs from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. I measured some security metrics in the insecure environment for 24 hours, apply some security controls to harden the environment, measure metrics for another 24 hours, then show the results

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Projects & Labs:

[File Permissions in Linux]

- Objective: The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure.

[Python]

- Objective: Update a file through Python algorithm. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.

[Apply Filters to SQL Queries]

- Objective: My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.
